			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Troy AirBNB started in 2008, and we were one of the original creators as well as pioneers of the idea of hosting space for travelers to lay their heads. After our kids were out of the house, we found ourselves with a lot of empty house and a little bit bored. My husband and I are very outgoing people and enjoy meeting others, so we got to thinking about how interesting it would be to rent out our newly empty space. This would allow us to meet interesting people from all over the world and at the same time make a profit.
			</p><br />
			<p>Our establishment was started with a few empty rooms in our cozy and humble home. We now host spaces to humble travelers all over the Troy AL, Montgomery AL, and the Prattville AL area. Our spaces come in several different for plans (Art Deco, Mid-Century Modern, Rustic, Traditional, etc..) as well as sizes (square footage). Our staff members undergo credit checks, as well as national criminal, civil, and personal background checks.
			</p><br />
			<p>Here at Troy AirBNB, we understand that the world is constantly changing, and we guarantee the privacy and comfort of our guest, with background checks, verifying profiles, and a clear and certain line of communication between those who chose to spend their valuable time at any of our establishments, and our staff. If there is anyway we can make your stay more comfortable please<a href="../contact/contact.html"><strong style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"> contact us</strong></a>.
